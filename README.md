# Welcome to Lycaon! Embark on a quest to solve the ancient puzzles found in the Codex Beastiarum. Here's some Lore!
Long ago, Lycaon was a brilliant summoner who sought to catalog and control every creature that walked between worlds. His obsession led him to craft the Codex Bestiarum, a living spellbook that could summon beasts from the mundane to the divine.
But in his hunger for mastery, Lycaon attempted the Forbidden Summoning‚Äîa ritual to call forth an entity beyond mortal comprehension. The spell backfired, twisting reality and sealing him within the Codex itself. His name was erased from history, his existence reduced to whispers in the margins of forgotten tomes.
Scholars and warlocks who have reached the final pages of the Codex speak of a great warning, written in a tongue older than the gods themselves. It tells of a beast that even Lycaon dared not name‚Äîa summoning so vast and catastrophic that the very ink of the Codex recoils from its presence.
Some believe that the Codex was never meant to be completed, that its final pages are a trap‚Äîa lure for the greedy and the foolish. And yet, the book still calls to those who would dare seek its truths.
Now, the Codex shifts and tests those who dare open it, offering power to those who solve its riddles‚Äîbut always guiding them toward the same fate. Some say Lycaon‚Äôs spirit lingers, watching, waiting, hoping that one day, someone will complete the final summoning and set him free, or replace him.
Will you decipher the riddles, summon creatures of legend, and claim the power of the forgotten beasts?
Or will you unlock a secret that should have remained lost forever?

# What is Lycaon
